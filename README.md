# GitHub Actions Automation Bot

This is a Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-35-TURBO API to generate a README.md file that explains the code in a repository. The README.md file will have a project description, instructions on how to install the dependencies and how to execute the code, how to contribute, and any references to external sources of information if available.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following dependencies:

- `openai`
- `dotenv`

You can install them by running:

```
pip install openai dotenv
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. (Optional) Set the OpenAI API base URL as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_BASE`.
4. (Optional) Set the directory to scan for Python files as an environment variable named `DIRECTORY`. If not set, the current directory will be used.
5. Run the script by executing `python main.py`.
6. The script will generate a `README.md` file in the root directory of the repository.

# Bottle Redis Service Broker

This is a Python implementation of a Redis Service Broker using Bottle and Docker. It provides a RESTful API that allows you to provision and bind Redis instances.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

## API

The service broker provides the following RESTful API:

### GET /v2/catalog

Returns the service catalog.

### PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id

Provisions a new Redis instance.

### DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id

Deprovisions a Redis instance.

### PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id

Binds a Redis instance to an application.

### DELETE /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/service_bindings/:binding_id

Unbinds a Redis instance from an application.
