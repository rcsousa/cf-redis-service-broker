# Service Broker for Redis

This project is a simple implementation of a service broker for a Redis database using the Bottle framework in Python. It allows users to provision and deprovision Redis instances, as well as bind and unbind them to applications.

- Python
- Bottle
- Docker
- Redis

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install bottle docker redis
```

## Execution

To execute the code, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `VCAP_APP_PORT`: The port on which the application will run (default is 9999).
- `VCAP_APP_HOST`: The host on which the application will run (default is 0.0.0.0).
- `DOCKER_HOST`: The host and port of the Docker API.
